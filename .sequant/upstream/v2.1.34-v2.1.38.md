## Relevant Findings

### 1. Sandbox bypass for Bash permissions fixed (v2.1.34)

**Category:** opportunity (security)
**Keywords matched:** Bash, permission
**Impact files:** .claude/settings.json

Commands excluded from sandboxing via `sandbox.excludedCommands` or `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` could previously bypass the Bash ask permission rule when `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` was enabled. Now fixed.

**Sequant impact:** Low. Sequant does not use `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` or `sandbox.excludedCommands`. Permission patterns use explicit `Bash(*)` rules. No action needed, but good security hygiene to note.

### 2. Bash permission matching for env var wrappers fixed (v2.1.38)

**Category:** opportunity (security)
**Keywords matched:** Bash, permission
**Impact files:** .claude/settings.json

Bash permission matching now correctly handles commands using environment variable wrappers (e.g., `FOO=bar command`).

**Sequant impact:** Low-Medium. Sequant's Bash permission patterns like `Bash(*)` are broad enough that this fix doesn't change behavior. However, if skills invoke commands with env var prefixes, permission matching is now more accurate. No action needed.

### 3. Writes to `.claude/skills` blocked in sandbox mode (v2.1.38)

**Category:** opportunity (security)
**Keywords matched:** skill
**Impact files:** .claude/skills/**/*.md

Claude Code now prevents the Write tool from modifying files in `.claude/skills/` when sandbox mode is active.

**Sequant impact:** Low-positive. Sequant manages skills via:
- `npm run sync:skills` (shell cp command — NOT affected by sandbox)
- Manual editing by developers (outside sandbox)
- Skills are read-only from Claude's perspective during execution

This restriction is actually beneficial — it prevents Claude from modifying its own instructions during skill execution, which aligns with sequant's phase isolation architecture. No action needed.

## No Action Required
