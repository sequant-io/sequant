## Relevant Findings

### opportunity: Skills in --add-dir auto-load

> Skills defined in `.claude/skills/` within additional directories (`--add-dir`) are now loaded automatically.

**Keywords:** skill
**Impact:** Sequant worktree workflow uses separate directories. Skills in worktree `.claude/skills/` will now auto-load when using `--add-dir`. This simplifies the developer experience — no manual skill loading needed.
**Action:** Verify worktree skills auto-load correctly. Update docs if needed.

### opportunity: Skill character budget scales with context window

> Skill character budget now scales with context window (2% of context), so users with larger context windows can see more skill descriptions without truncation.

**Keywords:** skill
**Impact:** Sequant has 19 skills, some large (e.g., /exec at 26KB, /solve at 22KB). The dynamic budget means users with larger contexts see more skill content. Could influence how we structure skill files — less need to aggressively trim.
**Action:** Note for future skill optimization. No immediate action.

### opportunity: Bash heredoc template literal fix

> Fixed: Bash tool no longer throws "Bad substitution" errors when heredocs contain JavaScript template literals like `${index + 1}`, which previously interrupted tool execution.

**Keywords:** Bash, tool
**Impact:** Sequant skills and hook scripts use heredocs with shell variable expansion. This fix prevents false errors when JS template literals appear in heredoc content. Removes a potential pain point for `/exec` phase work.
**Action:** No action needed — this is a bug fix that benefits sequant automatically.
