## Relevant Findings

### opportunity: New hook events — TeammateIdle and TaskCompleted

> Added `TeammateIdle` and `TaskCompleted` hook events for multi-agent workflows.

**Keywords:** hook, Task
**Impact:** `TaskCompleted` is significant. Sequant's pre-tool hook currently uses `PreToolUse` only. A `TaskCompleted` hook could enable post-sub-agent-completion logic — e.g., validating sub-agent output, updating workflow state when a parallel task finishes, or triggering the next phase in a pipeline.
**Impact files:** src/hooks/pre-tool-hook.ts, templates/hooks/pre-tool.sh
**Action:** Evaluate adding `TaskCompleted` hook for workflow state updates after sub-agent tasks. Medium priority — agent teams are still experimental but hook events work independently.

### opportunity: Task(agent_type) restriction in frontmatter

> Added support for restricting which sub-agents can be spawned via `Task(agent_type)` syntax in agent "tools" frontmatter.

**Keywords:** Task, agent, subagent, tool
**Impact:** Directly relevant to sequant skills. Currently skills reference sub-agent types in their body text (e.g., "use Explore agent for codebase search"). With `Task(agent_type)` in frontmatter, skills could enforce which agent types are allowed, preventing misuse and improving security. This is the most actionable finding.
**Impact files:** .claude/skills/**/*.md, templates/skills/**/*.md
**Action:** Consider adding `Task(Explore)`, `Task(Bash)` etc. to skill frontmatter `tools:` fields to restrict agent spawning per skill.

### opportunity: Agent memory frontmatter field

> Added `memory` frontmatter field support for agents, enabling persistent memory with `user`, `project`, or `local` scope.

**Keywords:** agent, settings
**Impact:** Agents can now declare persistent memory scope. This could enhance sequant's workflow — e.g., a `/qa` agent remembering past review patterns, or `/spec` recalling previous planning decisions. Currently sequant uses `.sequant/state.json` for persistence; native memory could complement this.
**Action:** Low priority — evaluate whether native agent memory is useful alongside sequant's state system.

### opportunity: Plugin name in skill descriptions

> Added plugin name to skill descriptions and `/skills` menu for better discoverability.

**Keywords:** plugin, skill
**Impact:** Sequant skills installed via plugin will now show "sequant:" prefix in the `/skills` menu. Improves discoverability for plugin users who may not know which skills come from sequant.
**Action:** No action needed — this is automatic for plugin installations. Verify it works as expected.
