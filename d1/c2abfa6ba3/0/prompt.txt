did anthropic release an update that killed tool calling?

---

Is that what happened?

---

here:\
Bash(cd /Users/tony/Projects/worktrees/feature/93-improve-reliability-harden-phas
      e-overlay-ts-dom-qu && echo "=== Non-null assertions (!) ===" && grep -cE
      '!\.' src/…)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1
     === Non-null assertions (\!) ===
     0

     === Non-null assertions (\!) ===
     0

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/tony/Projects/worktrees/feature/92-improve-perf-convert-lava-anima
      tion-pngs-to-webp && echo "=== Lazy loading check ===" && grep -n
      'loading="lazy"\|d…)
  ⎿  Error: Sibling tool call errored

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/tony/Projects/worktrees/feature/92-improve-perf-convert-lava-anima
      tion-pngs-to-webp && grep -n 'HTMLPictureElement\|qs-ship-frame'

  ⎿  Error: Sibling tool call errored

did we fix the skill templates to add || true to grep commands?

---

fix all
